### Testing mistral:latest


1. Create a branch: To create a new branch, run the following command in your terminal:
```java
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```
Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name you want to give your new branch. This will switch to your new branch and start working on it.
2. Make changes: Once you're on your new branch, you can make any necessary changes to your codebase.
3. Commit changes: When you've made changes, run the following command in your terminal:
```sql
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```
This will stage and commit all of the changes in your working directory. Replace `Your commit message` with a description of what you changed.
4. Merge your branch: To merge your branch back into the main branch (usually called `master`), run the following command in your terminal:
```java
git checkout master
git merge <new-branch-name>
```
Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 1. This will merge your changes into the main branch and update the repository with the latest changes.
5. Delete your branch: To delete your new branch, run the following command in your terminal:
```sql
git branch -d <new-branch-name>
```
Replace `<new-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created in step 1. This will remove your branch from the repository and free up space.

Overall, git branching and merging is a powerful tool for managing changes to your codebase. By following these steps, you can easily collaborate with others on a project and keep track of different versions of your code.

### Testing orca2:latest

One possible workflow for git branching and merging is:

- Create a new feature branch from the main (or master) branch, using the command `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`. This will create a copy of the main branch with a new name.
- Work on your feature branch, making changes and commits as needed. You can use any editor or tool to write and test your code, but you should follow some best practices, such as:
  - Write clear and concise commit messages that describe what you did and why. Use prefixes like `feat:` or `fix:` for feature and bug fixes respectively. Avoid blank or empty commits.
  - Keep your branch up to date with the main branch, by using the command `git pull` occasionally. This will fetch any changes from the main branch and merge them into your feature branch. You can also use `git rebase` to rewrite some parts of your history, but this should be done sparingly and carefully.
  - Run tests and linting tools on your feature branch, to check for errors or code smells. Use the command `git diff` to see the differences between your branch and the main branch, and fix any issues you find.
- When your feature branch is ready to be merged, use the command `git merge main`. This will create a pull request on GitHub, where you can review and comment on the changes. You should also update the commit messages and descriptions accordingly, using the format `feat(feature): description` or `fix(bug): description`.
- Once the pull request is approved by other developers, use the command `git merge main --no-ff` to merge your feature branch into the main branch. This will create a new commit that combines your changes with the existing code. You should also use the command `git push` to push your changes to the remote repository.


* Execution time for orca2:latest: 10 seconds.


### Testing llama2:latest


Here is a precise workflow for git branching and merging:

1. Create a new feature or bug fix branch:
	* Checkout the main (stable) branch (usually called `master`).
	* Use `git checkout -b` to create a new branch with the desired name.
	* Start working on your feature or bug fix in this new branch.
2. Make changes and commit them:
	* Follow the same workflow as above for each change you want to make.
	* When you're ready to commit, use `git commit -m "commit message"` to record your changes.
3. Merge your feature or bug fix branch with `master`:
	* Checkout the main (stable) branch (usually called `master`).
	* Use `git merge` to merge your feature or bug fix branch into `master`.
	* Review the changes made in your branch and make sure they are ready to be merged into `master`.
4. Resolve any conflicts:
	* After merging, Git may have found conflicts between the two branches.
	* Use `git status` to identify the conflicting files and use `git diff` to resolve the conflicts manually.
	* Once resolved, use `git commit` again to commit the changes.
5. Push your branch to a remote repository:
	* Use `git push` to send your branch to a remote repository (such as GitHub or Bitbucket).
	* Make sure to specify the correct branch when pushing using the `-u` or `--set-upstream` option.
6. Keep your branch up to date:
	* To keep your feature or bug fix branch updated, you can use `git pull` to fetch the latest changes from `master`.
	* If there are any conflicts after merging, repeat the conflict resolution process.
7. Test and deploy:
	* Once your feature or bug fix is merged with `master`, it's important to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
	* Deploy the updated code to production once you're satisfied with the changes.
8. Retire the branch:
	* Once your feature or bug fix is deployed and working correctly, you can retire the branch by merging it into `master` again using `git merge`.
	* Then, you can delete the branch if desired using `git branch -d`.

Best practices to keep in mind:

* Use meaningful branch names that describe the purpose of the branch.
* Always merge branches into `master`, never vice versa.
* Keep your branching and merging history well-organized by using descriptive commit messages and avoiding unnecessary branches.
* Use `git remote` to manage multiple remote repositories if needed.
* Use `git cherry-pick` to apply specific changes from one branch to another, instead of merging the entire branch. This can be useful when you want to apply a small set of changes without affecting the rest of the codebase.

### Testing llama2:13b


Sure! Here's a precise workflow for git branching and merging:

1. Create a `master` branch: This is the main branch where you will do your development work. It should always be in a stable, working state.
2. Create feature branches: When you start working on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch from the `master` branch. Give the branch a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the feature or fix.
3. Make changes in your feature branch: Work on your feature or bug fix in your feature branch. This is where you can make experimental changes without affecting the stability of the `master` branch.
4. Test and verify your changes: Before you merge your feature branch back into `master`, make sure to test and verify your changes thoroughly.
5. Merge your feature branch into `master`: Once you've completed your work and tested your changes, merge your feature branch into `master`. This will bring your changes into the main branch and make them available for other developers to use.
6. Push your changes to a remote repository: After merging your feature branch into `master`, push your changes to a remote repository (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) so that other developers can access your changes.
7. Create a pull request: Once you've pushed your changes to the remote repository, create a pull request to request that other developers review your changes. This gives them an opportunity to test and verify your changes before they are merged into `master`.
8. Review and merge pull requests: Other developers will review your pull request, test your changes, and provide feedback. If everything looks good, they will merge your pull request into `master`.
9. Repeat the process: Continue creating feature branches, making changes, testing, and merging as needed to complete your project.

Here are some additional best practices to follow:

* Use descriptive branch names that reflect the purpose of the branch.
* Keep your feature branches short-lived and focused on a single task or feature.
* Avoid working directly on the `master` branch, as this can cause conflicts and make it difficult to track changes.
* Use git hooks to enforce certain workflows, such as requiring code reviews before merging.
* Use git tags to mark important releases or milestones in your project.

By following this workflow, you can use git effectively to manage your development process, collaborate with other developers, and keep your codebase stable and well-maintained.


* Execution time for llama2:13b: 19 seconds.


### Testing llama2:70b


Here's a precise workflow for git branching and merging:

1. Create a new branch:
	* Checkout the main branch (usually "master")
	* Run `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` to create a new branch
2. Make changes and commit them:
	* Work on the new branch, making changes and committing them with meaningful commit messages
3. Push the changes to the remote repository:
	* Run `git push origin <new-branch-name>` to push the changes to the remote repository
4. Create a pull request:
	* Go to the repository's web interface (e.g. GitHub, GitLab) and create a pull request for the new branch
5. Review and merge the pull request:
	* Review the changes in the pull request and ensure they are ready to be merged
	* Merge the pull request into the main branch (usually "master") using the repository's web interface
6. Update the local repository:
	* Run `git pull origin master` to update the local repository with the changes from the main branch
7. Continue working and committing changes:
	* Continue working on the new branch, making changes and committing them as needed
8. Merge the new branch into the main branch:
	* Once the new branch is complete and tested, merge it into the main branch using `git checkout master; git merge <new-branch-name>`
9. Push the changes to the remote repository:
	* Run `git push origin master` to push the changes to the remote repository
10. Delete the new branch:
	* Run `git branch -d <new-branch-name>` to delete the new branch

This workflow allows for a clean and organized way of working on new features or bug fixes, while also ensuring that changes are thoroughly reviewed and tested before being merged into the main branch.

### Testing llama2-uncensored:latest

Here's a step-by-step workflow for git branching and merging:
1. Create a new feature branch from the master branch
2. Make changes to the branch and push them to remote
3. When you are ready to merge your feature branch back into the master branch, create a new branch called "feature" (or whatever name you want)
4. Check out the "master" branch
5. Use the "git cherry-pick" command to pick the commits from the feature branch and apply them to the master branch
6. Finally, push your changes to remote and merge with the origin
This workflow helps in managing complex projects where you want to keep a clean separation between development branches while maintaining a stable base for production use cases.


* Execution time for llama2-uncensored:latest: 9 seconds.


### Testing codellama:latest


Here is a precise workflow for git branching and merging:

1. Create a new branch: Use the `git checkout -b <branch_name>` command to create a new branch based on the current branch. This will create a new branch with the given name and switch to it.
2. Make changes: Once you are in the new branch, you can make changes to your code as needed. You can use the `git add` and `git commit` commands to stage and commit your changes.
3. Test changes: Before merging your changes into the main branch, it's a good idea to test them thoroughly to ensure that they are working correctly. You can use the `git checkout <branch_name>` command to switch back to the new branch and test your changes.
4. Merge with main branch: Once you have tested your changes and made any necessary adjustments, you can merge your new branch into the main branch using the `git merge <branch_name>` command. This will combine the changes from both branches and create a new commit that includes all of the changes.
5. Resolve conflicts (if any): If there are any conflicts between the two branches, you may need to resolve them before merging can occur. You can use tools like `git diff` and `git merge --abort` to help with this process.
6. Push your changes: Once you have merged your new branch into the main branch, you can push your changes to the remote repository using the `git push origin <branch_name>` command. This will update the remote branch with your changes.
7. Clean up: After you have merged your changes and pushed them to the remote repository, you may want to clean up your local branches by deleting the new branch. You can use the `git branch -d <branch_name>` command to do this.

By following these steps, you can create a new branch for development, make changes, test those changes, and then merge them into the main branch when they are ready. This workflow allows you to keep your branches organized and makes it easier to manage your codebase.

### Testing codellama:13b


Here is a precise workflow for git branching and merging:

1. Create a new branch from the main branch (usually "master"):
```bash
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```
2. Make changes to your code and commit them to the new branch:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "My new feature"
```
3. Periodically merge the main branch into your new branch to keep it up-to-date with the latest changes in the project:
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout my-new-branch
git merge master
```
4. Resolve any conflicts that may arise from the merge, and commit the changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main branch into my new branch"
```
5. When your feature is complete, push it to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin my-new-branch
```
6. Create a pull request on GitHub or another version control platform to merge your changes into the main branch:
* On GitHub, navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click the "New pull request" button.
* Select the base branch (usually "master") and the compare branch (your new feature branch).
* Write a descriptive title and description for your pull request.
* Click "Create pull request".
7. Once your pull request is approved, you can merge it into the main branch:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge my-new-branch
```
8. Push the merged changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin master
```
9. Delete the feature branch once it has been merged into the main branch, if desired:
```bash
git branch -D my-new-branch
```
This is a general workflow for git branching and merging, but there may be additional steps or variations depending on your specific project and workflow.


* Execution time for codellama:13b: 17 seconds.


### Testing codellama:34b

  The following is a straightforward workflow for Git branching and merging:

1. Create a new branch: To begin, create a new branch from the master branch using the command "git checkout -b [new_branch_name]." This will create a new branch with the name you specified and switch to it.
2. Make changes: On your newly created branch, make the desired changes to your codebase. These changes should be specific to the feature or bug fix you are working on, as this will allow you to easily manage and track your work.
3. Commit changes: Once you have made your changes, use the command "git add ." to stage them for committing. Then use "git commit -m "[commit message]" to commit the changes with a meaningful commit message that describes the changes you made.
4. Push changes to remote repository: To make sure your changes are safely stored on the remote repository, use the command "git push origin [branch_name]." This will upload your local branch to the remote repository and set it as the upstream branch for future pushes.
5. Create a pull request: Once you have pushed your changes to the remote repository, create a pull request by navigating to the repository on GitHub or GitLab and selecting "New pull request" from the dropdown menu next to the branch selector. Select the base branch you want to merge into (usually master) and the branch you want to merge from (your new feature branch). Add a title and description for your pull request, then create it.
6. Review and merge: Assign a reviewer to review your code changes and provide feedback. Once the reviewer has approved your changes, they can merge your pull request into the base branch. If there are any conflicts or issues with your code, you will need to address them before the pull request can be merged.
7. Delete local branch: After the pull request has been merged, delete your local feature branch using the command "git branch -d [branch_name]." This will remove the branch from your local repository and keep your working directory clean.
8. Update master branch: Finally, update your local master branch with the changes made in the remote repository by running "git pull origin master" or "git fetch origin master" followed by "git merge origin/master."

By following this workflow, you can easily create and manage feature branches in Git, collaborate with others on code reviews, and keep your codebase organized and up-to-date.

* Execution time for vicuna:latest: 9 seconds.


### Testing wizardcoder:latest

1. Create a new branch from the current branch: 
git checkout -b "new-branch"
This command creates a new branch called "new-branch" that is based on the current branch and checks it out. You can replace "new-branch" with any name you want to give your new branch.

2. Make changes or add files on the new branch: 
Make changes to the code or add files as needed for your new feature or bug fix on this branch.

3. Stage the changes and commit them to the new branch:
git add . 
This command stages all of the modified, deleted, or new files in the working directory. Git tracks changes made to tracked files and notices any untracked files that have been added or removed. 
git commit -m "commit message"
This commits your staged changes with a brief description of the changes you've made. Replace "commit message" with a descriptive message about what you changed, such as "Adding new feature XYZ" or "Fixing bug ABC."

4. Push the new branch to the remote repository: 
git push origin new-branch
This command will push your changes from your local repository to the remote repository, but only the new branch and not the current one. You'll need to specify which branch you want to push by replacing "origin" with the name of your remote repository.

5. Switch back to the main branch: 
git checkout main
This command switches you back to the main branch where you can continue working on other tasks or merge in your changes.

6. Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch: 
git pull origin main
This command fetches any changes that have been made since you last pulled and merges them into your local copy of the main branch. It will also update the "main" branch with the newest version on the remote repository, so you don't overwrite anyone else's work.

7. Merge the new branch into the main branch: 
git merge new-branch
This command merges your changes from the new branch into the main branch and keeps both versions of the code in sync. You will need to specify which branch you want to merge by replacing "new-branch" with the name of your new branch. If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them before completing the merge.

8. Push the updated main branch: 
git push origin main
This command updates the remote repository with any changes you made on the main branch. You'll need to specify which branch you want to push by replacing "origin" with the name of your remote repository.
